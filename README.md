# elm-training
This is a repo built to study elm and the architecture involved, along with practicing functional programming.
All finalized files will be compiled and operational on html files. So view of all projects should be easy.
Just download or clone this repository, then open any html file within the html folder.
However, if you wish to dig deeper into the code install elm and run the "elm-reactor" command.
This will allow all files to be viewed on your localhost:8000.
In order to install and understand Elm visit [Elm's Website](http://elm-lang.org/), they have great documentation.
## Additional Resource
Some exercises and example projects will come from James Moore's free [Elm Course](https://github.com/knowthen/elm) repo.
Make sure you check that out as well. It's the best course out for Elm.
It will be easy to get up to speed and follow along with this repo. Leave any advice (issues), and pull requests.
